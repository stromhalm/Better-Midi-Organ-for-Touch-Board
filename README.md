# Better MIDI Organ for Touch Board
This is an advanced version of the MIDI organ for Touch Boards by Bare Conductive. Just use the preferences in Midi_Instrument.ino to choose instruments, pitch, volumne and all/white notes. Be sure to [activate the built in MIDI mode](http://www.bareconductive.com/make/on-board-midi-mode/) on your board before usage.
